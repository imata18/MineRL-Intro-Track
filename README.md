# NeurIPS 2022: MineRL BASALT Competition Intro Track Baseline Submission Kit

[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/565639094860775436.svg)](https://discord.gg/BT9uegr)

This repository is the MineRL BASALT 2022 Competition Intro Track baseline solution.

MineRL BASALT Intro Track is designed to help you get familiar with the submission system and MineRL. Your task is to create an agent which can obtain a diamond shovel, starting from a random, fresh world.

The baseline agent gets a diamond about 10% of the time and sometimes crafts a diamond pickaxe. Your task is to make it craft a diamond shovel.

See [the AICrowd competition page](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2022-minerl-basalt-competition) for further information.

## Setting up

Install [MineRL v1.0.0](https://github.com/minerllabs/minerl) (or newer) and the requirements for [OpenAI VPT](https://github.com/openai/Video-Pre-Training).

Download the RL from Early Game model [.weights](https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/minecraft-rl/models/rl-from-early-game-2x.weights) and [.model](https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/minecraft-rl/models/2x.model) files for the OpenAI VPT model.

Place these files under `data` to match the following structure:

```
├── data
│   └── VPT-models
│       ├── 2x.model
│       └── rl-from-early-game-2x.weights
```

Before submitting, remember to add the models. For that you need to use `git lfs`. See instructions [here](https://discourse.aicrowd.com/t/how-to-upload-large-files-size-to-your-submission/2304).


## Visualizing the model

To watch the baseline agent play, uncomment the `env.render()` line in `test.py` and run the following command:
```
python test.py
```
This will run a single short episode. If you want to see complete episodes, set `debug` to `false` in `aicrowd.json`.

## How to Submit a Model on AICrowd.

To submit this baseline agent follow the [submission instructions](https://github.com/minerllabs/basalt_intro_track_2022_competition_submission_template), but use this repo instead of the starter kit repo.

Remember to add the newly added model files as part of the submission!
